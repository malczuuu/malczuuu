# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Damian

I'm a backend developer who mostly works with Java and Spring Boot. I like building solid APIs, writing clean code, and
automating things that shouldnâ€™t be manual.

Not really into flashy stuff â€” just trying to build things that work well and are easy to maintain. I spend most of my
time in IntelliJ, Docker, and terminals.

## What I use a lot

- Java, Spring Boot
- MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- Git, Docker
- A _pinch_ of Golang

## Notable Projects

Here's a list of projects that I'm the most proud of. Not a huge one, but perhaps it will eventually grow ðŸ˜Š.

- **Problem4J**: [RFC 7807 - Problem Details for HTTP APIs][rfc7807] in Java, available on `maven-central`.
    - [**`problem4j-spring`**][problem4j-spring]: Spring Boot integration for `Problem` model.
    - [**`problem4j-jackson`**][problem4j-jackson]: Jackson (`ObjectMapper`) integration for `Problem` model.
    - [**`problem4j-core`**][problem4j-core]: Plain `Problem` model for Java.

Here (and on https://malczuuu.github.io/) are some projects that are not very presentable yet. Perhaps one day ðŸ˜….

## Libraries

- [**`jakarta-validation-extensions`**](https://github.com/malczuuu/jakarta-validation-extensions): A library that adds
  a few custom jakarta-style annotations and validators. Project was created as a way to learn about publishing to
  `maven-central` so I'm not certain about its future yet.
- [**`pytemple`**](https://github.com/malczuuu/pytemple): Python library for simple formatted text generation based on
  template.

## Docker Compose Prototypes

- [**`composes`**](https://github.com/malczuuu/composes)
