# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Damian

I'm a backend developer who mostly works with Java and Spring Boot. I like building solid APIs, writing clean code, and automating things that shouldnâ€™t be manual.

Not really into flashy stuff â€” just trying to build things that work well and are easy to maintain. I spend most of my time in IntelliJ, Docker, and terminals.

## What I use a lot in mt free time

- Java, Spring Boot
- MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- Git, Docker
